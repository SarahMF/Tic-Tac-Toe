# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first repository on GitHub

I am new to programming and this is my first project. I managed to write most of the code so it allows the game to be played with a couple of small glitches:
  1. When player X wins or if there is a tie, the announcement of the outcome of the game is printed twice. How can I change      it so that it is only printed once. When player O wins, it only prints once. 
  2. If a number outside of the 1-9 range is typed as the input, it results in an error. I tried to add a line of code to ask       the user to input a different number to play but it still just gives an error saying it is out of range. 

If there is any advice you have for me or if you can add/fix my code, I welcome your input. Thanks
